<p>To merge a branch in GitHub, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Merge the branch:</strong> Merge the branch into your current branch using the following command. This example merges the 'master' branch from the remote 'origin' repository. Replace 'master' with the name of the branch you want to merge.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li><strong>Commit the merge:</strong> After merging, commit the changes with a meaningful message.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m "Merge unrelated histories"</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Push the changes to GitHub:</strong> Finally, push the changes to the remote repository. Replace 'main' with the name of your target branch.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git push origin main</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error related to unrelated histories, it means the branches have diverged and Git cannot automatically merge them. In this case, you can either open Git Bash in the file directory or clone the repository again and navigate to the directory using the following commands:</p>

<p>The first command clones the repository to your local machine, and the second command navigates into the directory of the cloned repository.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone <repository_URL></code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;repository_URL&gt;</code> with the URL of the repository you want to clone.</p>
